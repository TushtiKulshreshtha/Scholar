StudyScholar is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, 
consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN 
stack, which includes ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS

Aim: 

1). Providing seamless and interactive learning experience for students.

2). Creating platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with 
learners across the globe.


Front-end
To build the front end, we use frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS (for 
building user interfaces). We also use CSS and Tailwind, which are styling 
frameworks that help make the user interface look good and responsive. 

Additionally, we use some npm packages to add extra functionality to the front 
end. To manage the state of the application, we use Redux, which is a popular state 
management library for React.


Development environment: VSCode
